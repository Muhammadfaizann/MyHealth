<h3><p style="color:#E11937;">What is Lung Cancer?</p></h3>
<p>
When cancer develops in the lungs, the cells change and grow in an abnormal way. Many lung cancers begin in the wall of the bronchi. As the cancer grows it forms a collection of cells (tumour). This tumour can then cause a blockage and result in symptoms, for example, difficulty in breathing. </p>
<p style="color:#E11937;"><strong>Lung Cancer Symptoms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>A cough that doesn't go away or a change in a long-term cough</li>
<li>Repeated chest infections that won't go away even after antibiotics</li>
<li>Wheezing</li>
<li>Feeling more tired than usual</li>
<li>A hoarse voice</li>
<li>Coughing up blood-stained phlegm</li>
<li>Pain in your chest, especially when you cough or breathe in</li>
<li>Loss of appetite</li>
<li>Weight loss</li>
<li>Swelling around your face and neck</li>
<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any of the above symptoms, you must have them checked out by your doctor. But remember they can occur in many conditions other than cancer.</p>
